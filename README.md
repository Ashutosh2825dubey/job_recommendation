# Job Recommendation Engine

A content‑based job role recommendation engine that matches user-entered skills with job titles using machine learning. Built as part of the **SkillHunt** project, this module powers personalized job suggestions.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This engine uses **content-based filtering** to recommend job roles to users based on their skill set. It was designed to integrate seamlessly with the broader SkillHunt platform.

### 🔍 Core Features

- Trains a model using job and user-skill data.
- Uses TF‑IDF vectorization to encode skill and job descriptions.
- Computes cosine similarity to match user skills with suitable job roles.
- Outputs top N job role suggestions for a user’s profile.

## 💻 Installation

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ashutosh2825dubey/job_recommendation.git
   cd job_recommendation
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ▶️ Usage

### From Notebook

- Launch Jupyter (or Jupyter Lab) and open `jobrecommendation_code.ipynb`.
- Follow the steps to preprocess data, train the model, evaluate performance, and generate recommendations.

### From Flask App

1. Run the API:  
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Send a POST request to `/recommend` with JSON payload:

```json
{
  "skills": [
    "Python", "Machine Learning", "Flask", "NLP"
  ],
  "top_n": 5
}
```

3. Example response:
```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    "Data Scientist",
    "Machine Learning Engineer",
    "Backend Developer",
    "NLP Engineer",
    "Data Analyst"
  ]
}
```

📌 Customize model input/output format as needed for integration.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User inputs their skill-set list.
2. Job descriptions and skill profiles are vectorized using TF‑IDF.
3. Cosine similarity scores are computed between user skills and job vectors.
4. Top matching job titles are returned.


## 🧪 Dependencies

Key libraries used:

- Python ≥ 3.7
- `numpy`, `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `Flask`
- Jupyter (optional for notebook work)

---

## 📌 Integration

This engine is designed to plug into the **SkillHunt** platform:

- Takes user profile data (skills)
- Returns ranked job titles
- Can be extended to fetch full job listings or metadata

---

## ✍️ Future Enhancements

- Add collaborative filtering or hybrid recommendation strategies
- Incorporate resume parsing for skill extraction
- Fine-tune TF‑IDF parameters or use word embeddings
- Build a web UI/dashboard for interactive role exploration
